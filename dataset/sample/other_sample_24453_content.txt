Other Mixer Direct has a large selection of chemical mixing tanks but also specializes in getting a custom stainless steel vessel tank quickly designed and built using our pre-engineered designs to which we can add fittings and mountings for both stainless steel, carbon steel, and poly tanks vessels.
