The liquid contacts the blade and moves outward to to flow over the teeth breaking the agglomerations into increasing smaller particles. The Ultra Shear 304 stainless steel blade includes extra surface area at the blade tip to facilitate even higher levels of shear in the product. This leads to even faster throughput! Typically used in paints and inks, they are now being used in a variety of industries for increased efficiency.High Flow Dispersion Blades rotate at high RPMs to facilitate the quick impartation of solids at a fine grind. The liquid contacts the blade and moves outward to to flow over the teeth breaking the agglomerations into increasing smaller particles. Most Dispersion blades have issues related to sufficient fluid motion to get a batch to complete uniformity. MixerDirect addresses that problem with the HFD line. Each blade has axial flow blades integrated into the geometry of the blade, providing extra flow for higher viscosity applications.
