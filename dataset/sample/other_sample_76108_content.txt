Other Low shear impeller designs are intended to impart motion to the product while using the least amount of energy possible. To do this, the blades of these mixing propellers are specifically designed for low drag and smooth flow. For example, a large storage tank full of mixed product might need a very efficient way to keep the mixture stable and prevent separation by turning it over periodically. For this application use a low-shear, high-efficiency hydrofoil which will minimize power consumption while keeping the product in motion.
