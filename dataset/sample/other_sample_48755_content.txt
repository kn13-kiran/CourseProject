THESE TERMS PREVAIL OVER ANY OF BUYER’S GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR WHEN BUYER HAS SUBMITTED ITS TERMS TO SELLER. ANY TERMS, CONDITIONS AND/OR PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN BUYER’S INSTRUCTIONS OR ITS PURCHASE ORDER WHICH ARE IN ANY WAY INCONSISTENT WITH OR IN ADDITION TO THESE TERMS HEREIN ARE HEREBY REJECTED BY SELLER AND SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THESE TERMS OR BINDING IN ANY WAY UPON SELLER.

Title and Delivery. All Goods will be delivered in accordance with the terms in the Sales Order. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, Seller shall deliver the Goods FOB Shipping Point to the address specified by the Buyer in the Sales Order (the “Delivery Point”) using Seller’s standard methods for packaging and shipping such Goods. Buyer shall be responsible for all freight, delivery, loading, and unloading costs and shall provide the equipment and labor necessary to receive and unload the Goods at the Delivery Point. Title and risk of loss to the Goods shall pass to Buyer at such time as the Seller delivers the Goods to the common carrier at the Seller’s shipping facility (the “Shipping Date”). Upon common carrier’s receipt of the Goods at the Seller’s Shipping facility, any subsequent loss or damage to the Goods shall not relieve Buyer from any payment obligation. Seller shall not be liable for any delays, loss or damage in transit. Buyer shall be responsible for pursuing any claims for loss or damage with the common carrier; provided, however, that Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer with respect to such claims. Notwithstanding passage of title to Buyer on the Shipping Date, Seller shall retain a security interest and right of repossession in the Goods until Buyer has made payment in full. Therefore, as collateral for the payment of the sales price of the Goods, Buyer hereby grants to Seller a lien on and security interest in and to all of the right, title and interest of Buyer in, to and under the Goods, wherever located, and whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired from time to time, and in all accessions thereto and replacements or modifications thereof, as well as all proceeds (including insurance proceeds) of the foregoing. The security interest granted under this provision constitutes a purchase-money security interest under the Kentucky Uniform Commercial Code. Buyer agrees to cooperate in whatever manner necessary, including executing the applicable UCC filing statements, to assist Seller in the perfection of such security interest. Mixer Direct Inc. dba MXD Process Seller reserves the right, in its sole discretion, without liability or penalty, to make partial shipments of Goods to Buyer. Each shipment will constitute a separate sale, the Agreement is severable as to any such partial shipment, and Buyer shall pay for the units shipped whether such shipment is in whole or partial fulfillment of Buyer’s Sales Order. Delay in delivery or other default of any shipment shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to accept and pay for remaining deliveries. All delivery dates are approximate. Buyer shall be responsible for all import duties, taxes, and any other expenses incurred or licenses or clearances required at port of entry and destination, and shall be responsible for the costs, if any, incurred by Seller in relation to expedited or “RUSH” orders. Shipping dates are approximate only, and Seller shall not be liable for any damage, loss or expense incurred by Buyer if Seller fails to meet the specified shipping dates. If special or export packaging is requested by Buyer and approved by Seller in writing or, in the opinion of Seller, required under the circumstances, the cost of shipping, if not set forth on the Sales Order or invoice, will be separately invoiced to and payable by the Buyer. Unless specifically agreed in writing all shipments shall be to the same address. In the event Buyer requests a delay in shipment of completed Goods of longer than one (1) week following date of completion, Buyer agrees that Seller may move such completed Goods to a third-party offsite storage facility until the Goods are shipped to Buyer. Seller shall invoice Buyer for all moving and storage costs for such completed Goods. Buyer shall be responsible for insuring, at its own expense, any completed Goods held at the storage facility against loss or damage. The Buyer shall bear the risk of loss and any loss or damage to the Goods will not relieve Buyer from any payment obligation. If for any reason Buyer fails to accept delivery of any of the Goods on the date fixed pursuant to Seller's notice that the Goods have been delivered at the Delivery Point, or if Seller is unable to deliver the Goods at the Delivery Point on such date because Buyer has not provided appropriate instructions, documents, licenses or authorizations: (i) the Goods shall be deemed to have been delivered; and (ii) Seller, at its option, may store the Goods until Buyer picks them up, whereupon Buyer shall be liable for all related costs and expenses (including, without limitation, storage and insurance). Except for Seller’s right to replace Nonconforming Goods as provided herein, all sales of Goods to Buyer are made on a one-way basis, and Buyer has no right to return Goods purchased under this Agreement to Seller.2. Buyer’s Acts or Omissions. If Seller’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of Buyer or its agents, subcontractors, consultants, or employees, Seller shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise liable for any costs, charges, or losses sustained or incurred by Buyer, in each case, to the extent arising directly or indirectly from such prevention or delay. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that upon Seller’s delivery of the Goods to the common carrier at the Seller’s shipping facility, the Buyer’s obligation to pay the Seller is fixed and is not contingent upon any subsequent act, including, without limitation, the payment or non-payment by a customer of the Buyer3. Inspection and Rejection of Nonconforming Goods. Buyer shall inspect the Goods within ten (10) business days of delivery of the Goods to the Delivery Point (“Inspection Period”). Buyer will be deemed to have accepted the Goods unless it notifies Seller in writing Mixer Direct Inc. dba MXD Process Customer Terms & Conditions of any Nonconforming Goods before the end of the Inspection Period and furnishes such written evidence or other documentation as required by Seller. “Nonconforming Goods” means only Goods shipped that are different than the quantity or quality identified in the Sales Order. The quantity of any installment of Goods as recorded by Seller or common carrier on dispatch from Seller’s facility is conclusive evidence of the quantity received by the Buyer unless Buyer provides conclusive evidence to the contrary within ten (10) business days of delivery of the Goods. The Buyer is responsible for any costs associated with inspecting the Goods, provided the Seller shall reimburse the Buyer’s inspection costs for Nonconforming Goods. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of any Nonconforming Goods, Seller shall, in its sole discretion, (i) replace such Nonconforming Goods with conforming Goods, or (ii) credit or refund the Price for such Nonconforming Goods, together with any reasonable shipping and handling expenses incurred by Buyer in connection therewith. The Seller shall pay the shipping expense for Nonconforming Goods returned to the Seller and incur the risk of loss. If Seller exercises its option to replace Nonconforming Goods, Seller shall, after receiving shipment of Nonconforming Goods, ship to Buyer, at Seller’s expense and risk of loss, the replaced Goods to the Delivery Point. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the remedies set forth in this Section 4 are Buyer’s exclusive remedies for the delivery of Nonconforming Goods.4. Price and Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall purchase the Goods from Seller at the price(s) (the “Price”) set forth as of the date the Seller accepts the Sales Order accompanying these Terms. All Prices are exclusive of all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any Governmental Authority on any amounts are payable by Buyer. All invoices for deliveries to a Kentucky address shall separately include Kentucky sales and use tax unless Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a resale certificate or manufacturer’s sales and use tax exemption certificate in acceptable to Seller. Buyer shall be solely and directly responsible for the reporting of sales, use, excise, and any other similar taxes in any states other than Kentucky. If sales or other transfer taxes are not paid at the time of the sale, and are later determined to be applicable to the sale by a state of competent jurisdiction, the Buyer agrees to pay the sales or other transfer taxes at such later time. In the event that legal proceedings are employed to collect any payment, all costs thereof shall be paid by the Buyer.5. Terms and Method of Payment. Buyer shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the total sales price, including, without limitation, shipping, freight, and transfer taxes, on or before the Shipping Date, except where satisfactory open credit is established in Seller’s sole discretion, in which case the terms will be as negotiated by the Seller and the Buyer. If the Goods are delivered in installments, Buyer shall pay for each installment in accordance with the terms of payment set forth herein, and Buyer’s obligation to pay for such installment shall accrue regardless of whether the remaining installments are delivered. If Buyer fails to make any payment when due, Seller reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance under any or all Sales orders or agreements under which Seller has extended credit to Buyer or pursue any other remedy available to Seller. Seller’s suspension of performance may result in a rescheduling delay contingent on availability. All quotes and payments shall be in United States dollars. Buyer shall make all payments hereunder by wire transfer, check, ACH, or credit card (in which case additional fees apply). All late payments shall bear interest at the rate of the lesser of (i) the maximum rate allowable by law, or (ii) 1.5% per month.
