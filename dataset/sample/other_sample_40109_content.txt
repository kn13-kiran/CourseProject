Other Dispersion Blades rotate at high RPMs to facilitate the quick impartation of solids at a fine grind. The liquid contacts the blade and moves outward to flow over the teeth and break the agglomerations into increasingly smaller particles. Typically used in paints and inks, high shear mixer blades are now being used in a variety of industries for increased efficiency. Stiffening plates can be used in conjunction with dispersion blades to increase blade life. Our bolt on hubs, weld on hubs, and blade adapter shafts allow for easy installment of all high shear dispersion blades. Dependent on your mixing needs, your Dispersion Blade can be finished with a #4, 2B Mill, or an electro-polished finish.Dispersion Blades rotate at high RPMs to facilitate the quick impartation of solids at a  fine grind.
