Other Heating or cooling your stainless steel mixing tank can be a constant struggle. A stainless tank can require ASME certification at certain temperatures and pressures. If heating dead spots must be eliminated in any of your stainless steel mixing tanks, Mixer Direct's manufacturing includes an innovative bottom dimple jacket that does just that with still one inlet and outlet on the stainless tank. Our fiberglass insulation and stainless sheathing insure a spectacular finish and increased safety. Another challenge in stainless steel mixing tanks is applying the correct surface finish. Mixer Direct can work with you to find the right finish for your application. We can achieve something as precise as a single digit Ra finish with passivation and electropolish, to something as cost effective as a 2B mill finish and anything in between on stainless steel mixing tanks. Achieving the right surface finish is crucial to limit bacterial growth in biological applications and cleaning time in all stainless tank applications.
