Posted on November 6 by doctorgalacticWell…2020’s been a bit of a mare hasn’t it? I’d joke about it in my usual off the cuff way, but to be honest… it’s not funny. These have been difficult times for many of you. Best wishes to you all.What I can do is try to lighten the mood a little with the announcement that #RealTimeChem Week is baaaack!For those not already in the know, #RealTimeChem Week is a 7 day themed event to help raise awareness of the #RealTimeChem chemistry community on Twitter and encourage as many chemists as possible to tweet about their chemistry as they are doing it. During the week there will hopefully be various events to take part in, competitions and prizes are on offer, so it’s the perfect week to jump in and share some socially distanced chemistry with your fellow chemists.If you are completely new to the community and want to know more about #RealTimeChem in general, then follow this link to the regular “About…” page, where you can learn all about the project and the community.So, why not take some time during #RealTimeChem Week to share some chemistry and connect to other chemists in the world and have some fun while you’re at it? I think right now we could use some fun.I’m sure you have questions, you’re scientists. Here’s some common questions and the related answers below, including details on this year’s theme, events and competitions:Just tweet about chemistry using the hashtag #RealTimeChem. Simple as that. You can also use this year’s theme hashtag #ChemAtHome. That hashtag will also be monitored by me and co-curator Laura during the event. Hell use both. Go wild. Just use one of these hashtags or you’ll be lonely.Please note that there are there are other hashtags you should use to enter the related competitions, more details on these are below.Being that many people in the word have spent more time than usual at home this year due to  it’s perhaps not surprising that the theme is  #ChemAtHome!Chemistry doesn’t just happen in the laboratory or the office, it happens at home too (particularly in 2020).It’s all here folks: pets on your keyboard! kids in your zoom calls! Chemistry in the kitchen! Chemistry on the kitchen floor! Facemasks! Social distancing!  Online conferences!  Experiments in your shed!So time to take off your lab coat, put on your most comfortable clothes and then do some #RealTimeChem! ** Okay Lab work is perfectly fine too, but make sure you’re COVID secure.Just like all previous years, the main event of #RealTimeChem Week is the Awards. These are given to our favourite tweets during #RealTimeChem Week. The format this year is pretty much the same as previous years with some funky new categories based on this year’s theme.As before, C&EN have again kindly sponsored all the award categories with a prize. Below are some details about the awards**Please note some details may be subject to change.The winners for each category will have their tweets featured in a news story by C&EN, to be published online in December. In addition to this, the 7 winners will receive:Tweets posted on all seven days of the event (30th November – 6th December) are eligible for the awards. They must, however, fall into one of the following “best of” categories (summarized here excellently by Andy):Therefore, to potentially win a prize in the awards all you have to do is tweet something within these categories using #RealTimeChem (or #ChemAtHome) using the appropriate hashtag during the week.There will also be a Reader’s choice award this year! This will have a prize of  a $100 Amazon Gift Card Prize (or equivalent for non-US locations) courtesy of C&EN. More details on how this award will be run coming soon.We will be keeping an eye on the hashtag and gathering up the best tweets with a summary of winners, published in C&EN. As mentioned there will be one winner per category and two honorable mentions as runners up (sadly no additional prizes are available for runners up).Prizes winners will be announced by C&EN after the event.Winners will be asked to provide name and address details via DM or email.Below you will find banners to help you share the word about #RealTimeChem Week 2020. Designed again by the awesome Andy Brunning of @compoundinterest as usual! (www.compoundchem.com) Feel free to print out and put them around your house even.There are some plans in progress for other events for the week that may (or may not) happen. Like a lot of people we’ve experienced a lot of disruption due to the pandemic and so the original larger plans have had to be scaled back a bit. If other events do happen we’ll write them up here.There is always room for more chemistry-based fun. If you would like to run an event or competition during #RealTimeChem Week, then please get in touch with me via realtimechem@gmail.com and I’ll be happy to chat about the possibilities.
Posted on November 5, 2019 by doctorgalacticHi #RealTimeChemists,Long time, no write-y the blog-y. My heartfelt apologies for this, but life this year has somewhat caught up with me and haven’t been able to spend as much time on #RealTimeChem as I normally would. Hence, the lack of an official full scale #RealTimeChem Week this year. I know, sad times. I will make amends in 2020 with a full #RealTimeChem relaunch which puts you, the community front and center and provides plenty more opportunities to share chemistry and generally geek out about it in real time.Anyway, enough of my incoherent ramblings. To tide you over and also to celebrate this years International Year of the Periodic Table (#IYPT2019), we’ve teamed up with the wonderful chemistry crazed folks at C&EN to bring you a little competition to get your PPE protected teeth into: #RealTimeElements.The basic idea is to capture an image or video that showcases a particular element in the periodic table. Be imaginative, be spectacular, be elemental.  The element should be clear visually or mentioned in the description with your submission. You should also use this the competition hashtag #RealTimeElements.Each category (video and image) have a grand prize and two runners-up. All winners will receive a limited-edition C&EN IYPT travel mug. The grand-prize winners will also receive a $50 gift card and a special print of their image or a film-reel-style print of shots from their video.All the competition details can be found on C&EN’s competition page here. Please make sure to read the full rules before entering. You can take part on Twitter (of course), but also on Instagram. Alternatively, you can enter via submission form on the competition page.The competition runs from 11th November to 17th November 2019.Have fun everybody, I can’t wait to see what fantastic images and videos you come up with during #RealTimeElements Week.-Doctor Galactic- P.S. If you have any ideas for other element based fun during #RealTimeElements Week, please feel free to let me know!
Posted on February 13, 2019 by doctorgalacticYes, it is nearly that time of year again (no, it’s not #RealTimeChem Week just yet! But I like your enthusiasm), it’s almost #RSCPoster time!In case you don’t know #RSCPoster is a Twitter conference that bring members of the chemistry research community (such as your wonderful selves) together to share their research, network and engage in rigorous scientific debate.This year the event will be on Tuesday 5
March 2019, 09:00 GMT – Wednesday 6 March 2019, 09:00 GMT.Please note! You must register to take part. Registration is open
and can be done: here.If you want to know (a lot) more about how it works please follow this link to the RSC Publishing Blog, which has all the information you need on how to take part.Here’s also some quick information to give you the basics and all the subject hashtags:You may have noticed that I, and by extension @RealTimeChem, am one of the General Committee members this year for the conference, so I’m going to do my best to engage as much as possible.Now there was a considerable number of posters last year, but my challenge will be to comment on as many as humanly possible during the day, including an appropriate GIF. The challenge for all of you, if you choose to accept it (don’t worry this blog won’t spontaneously combust) is to do the same! Make sure you’re using #RSCPoster in all your replies and let’s help this conference get trending and spread chemistry far and wide on Twitter, especially in the International Year of the Periodic Table (so it’s it about elements use #IYPT2019!).I hope to see you all there (metaphorically speaking)! Have fun everybody!-Doctor Galactic-
Posted on November 23, 2018 by doctorgalactic2018. My how the years fly by. This year’s #RealTimeChem Week was all about #Chem4Life, a theme chosen by community member Gabriele Laudadio (@g_laudadio) who wrote an excellent summary here that is far more poetic than I can possibly be. Suffice to say, it was another fun week of all things chemistry and thanks have to go out to everyone who joined in and tweeted.While the week event is over for yet another year, don’t forget that #RealTimeChem is a 24/7 project, so feel free to keep sharing chemistry whenever you want and engage with your fellow chemists around the world.As ever, this event doesn’t happen without a variety of people behind the scenes to whom I must offer a shout out:FYI, if you are looking for the main #RealTimeChem Awards these are being posted by C&EN magazine today – here’s a link to the post: https://cen.acs.org/people/awards/2018-RealTimeChem-Week-Awards/96/web/2018/11Now, Cook Off prizes time. Below I will announce the winners of The Great #RealTimeChem Cook Off 2018:As mentioned above this year’s contest was sponsored again by @WileyVCH‘s society chemistry journals.* The five winners below all receive a ChemPubSoc Europe package containing:–A copy of What’s Cooking in Chemistry: How Leading Chemists Succeed in the Kitchen-An exclusive #chemquackers scientist rubber duck (everybody wants one of these.

Posted on November 12, 2018 by doctorgalacticLadies and Gentlemen,Welcome to the 2018 #RealTimeChem week! My suggestion for this year’s theme was the most voted on Twitter and it’s now time to explain to all of you why I proposed this hashtag.First of all, my name is Gabriele Laudadio, and I am currently pursuing my PhD at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the group of Dr. Timothy Noël. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by chemistry and how the interaction between different molecules originated life as we know it. For this reason, as soon as I graduated high school student, I decided to go for it: I wanted to be a chemist!From the very beginning, I realized how tough studying chemistry can be. So many different disciplines, so many different courses to attend. None of this scared me though, quite the opposite happened: the more I got into the field, the more I knew that it was worth all my time.Learning the basics of chemistry felt like learning a new language. Atoms make up the alphabet, molecules can be used to form sentences and drawing reaction mechanisms pretty much compares to grammar: the rules are clear but there’s always an exception! The amazing thing about the chemical language? It’s universal! Chemistry can be used to communicate with any other fellow chemist around the world and to unravel the mystery of our universe.Looking back to the last couple centuries, it’s so clear that chemistry not only serves the purposes of the chemical community, but affects society as a whole. From the understanding of microbiology to new approaches in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, from the production of polymers to the relevance of transition metal complexes in drug discovery…this list could be so long! What’s certain is that the Chemistry in all these discoveries radically changed the Life of every human being on this planet.And that’s where the theme I suggested comes from: a reminder that Chemistry and Life are indissolubly linked together. What’s left to us chemists, scientists, and curious tweeps around the world is the task to learn the language of chemistry to interact with Nature. Have you had the chance in your career to glimpse into the bond between Chemistry and Nature? How did your research contribute to bring us one step further as society? Tell us all about it this week! This will be an awesome discussion I am certainly looking forward to!But there’s also a second meaning for this #Chem4Life RealTimeChem week, one for all the insiders of the chemistry world. Nothing in life binds people together like common passions and interests, so this week we want to know how Chemistry impacted your own life. Which people/places/adventures changed your life as a chemist? Myself, I had the chance to meet fantastic people during my studies: many of my lab mates are among my best friends and I even had the luck to find love over chemistry books (My wife probably knew I liked her the moment I enthusiastically offered her my jealously guarded Org Chem notes during our masters ☺)So let’s use the great platform of Twitter to talk about Life in Chemistry!And don’t get me wrong: I know life as a chemists is not all sunshine and rainbows. There’s many challenges all of us face when devoting our time to Chemistry, both as scientists and as human beings. So don’t hold back and feel free to start any discussions on “the dark side” of chemistry as well… (what about working-life balance, funding situation, preprint papers, issues with the peer-reviewing systems, diversity in science, intercultural awareness in international labs…)I certainly hope that this #Chem4Life will be a great opportunity for all chemists to remind ourselves of how lucky we are to work in this great field, to inspire and support each other through real-life examples and to reflect as a community on what we hope to achieve/improve in the future.Chemistry for Life and Life in Chemistry, one for all, all for one!Enjoy this lovely week, and don’t’ forget the hashtag! #Chem4Life.–Gabriele–
Posted on October 23, 2018 by doctorgalacticIt’s almost that time again, time for #RealTimeChem Week! Apologies for the late notice this year, I’ve had a bit of a rollercoaster, which has slowed up my usually efficient creation of this FAQ for the week. Anyway…For those not in the know, #RealTimeChem Week is a 7 day event to help raise awareness of the #RealTimeChem chemistry community on Twitter and encourage as many chemists as possible to tweet about their chemistry as they are doing it. During the week various events, competitions and prizes are on offer, so it’s the perfect week to jump in and share some chemistry with your fellow chemists.If you are completely new to the community and want to know more about #RealTimeChem in general, then follow this link to the regular “About…” page, where you can learn all about the project and the community.So, why not take some time during #RealTimeChem to share some chemistry and connect to other chemists in the world and have some fun while you’re at it?I’m sure you have questions, you’re scientists. Here’s some common questions and the related answers below, including details on the various competitions you can enter:Just tweet about chemistry using the hashtag #RealTimeChem. Simple as that. You can also use this year’s theme hashtag #Chem4Life. That will also be monitored by me during the event. Hell use both. Go wild. Just use one of these hashtags or you’ll be lonely.Please note that there are a lot of different events this year and there are other hashtags you should use to enter the related competitions, more details on these are below.The theme this year has, like in previous years, it’s own hashtag #Chem4Life – as chosen via poll by the community itself and suggested by @g_laudadio. My interpretation is as follows:Chemistry isn’t just the scientific subject that we love. It is an ever present part of our daily lives. You find chemistry everywhere. It’s in the foods we eat and the air we breathe. It can clean your sink and make your car rust. It can make you fall in love and make you cry. It is there is every child’s toy and Chemistry is there in every object you see or touch, whether you realise it or not.This year’s theme, #Chem4Life, celebrates the chemistry you encounter during your day.Below you will find banners to help you share the word about #RealTimeChem Week 2018. Designed again by the awesome Andy Brunning of @compoundinterest as usual! (www.compoundchem.com)Just like all previous years, the main event of #RealTimeChem Week is the Awards. These are given to our favourite tweets during #RealTimeChem Week. The format this year is pretty much the same as last year with a few changes to categories for added variety and a new means of announcing the results.This year, C&EN have kindly sponsored all the award categories with a top prize.The winner and 2 runners up for each category will have their tweets featured as a news story by C&EN, to be published online on 23rd November. In addition to this, the 8 winners i.e. those at the top of each category will receive:This years mug. Looking mighty fine.This years mug. Looking mighty fine.Tweets posted on all seven days of the event (12th-18th November) are eligible for the awards. They must, however, fall into one of the following “best of” categories:Most of these categories are intentionally broad and they hopefully cover the majority of areas that #RealTimeChem encompasses.Therefore, to potentially win a prize in the awards all you have to do is tweet something within these categories using #RealTimeChem during the week. I’ll be keeping an eye on the hashtag and gathering up the best tweets with a summary of winners, published in C&EN. As mentioned there will be one winner per category and two honorable mentions as runners up (sadly no additional prizes are available for runners up).Prizes winners will be announced by C&EN on  Friday 23rd November.Winners will be asked to provide name and address details via DM or email. Please note that mug prizes will be sent out during December/early January.Now in its fourth glorious year, The Great #RealTimeChem Cook Off is back! It doesn’t get any more everyday than the chemistry of cooking.Once again, this year’s contest is sponsored by the @ChemPubSoc_Euro journals.*Five winners will receive a ChemPubSoc Europe package containingA look at the goodies on offer as prizes.A look at the goodies on offer as prizes.The competition only takes place on the weekend of #RealTimeChem Week. Feel free to cook something during the week, but the tweet must be shared on the weekend of November 17th-18th to count.All you have to do to enter the competition is to tweet your culinary creation (anything cooking, baking or food related) and include #RealTimeChem #whatscooking & @ChemPubSoc_Euro at the end of your tweet. Your tweet should include a picture or video of your creation and ideally have a short description (the description can even talk about the chemistry in your cooking! It’s up to you). Alternatively, you can write/link a recipe for others to try.Everyone who tweets a cooking-related post using these hashtags will be entered into the competition, and 5 favourites will win a prize.Good luck and have fun cooking (also eating)!Disclaimer: I will not be held personally responsible for #RealTimeChem related cake overdoses or weight gain as a result of this cook off.—
*@ChemEurJ, @ChemistrySelect, @ChemistryOpen, @ChemBioChem, @ChemCatChem, @ChemMedChem, @ChemElectroChem, @ChemPhysChem, @ChemPlusChem, @ChemSusChem,@ChemPhotoChem, @EurJIC, and Eur. J. Org. Chem (all journals of @ChemPubSoc_Euro); @ChemAsianJ, @AsianJOrgChem, and @ChemNanoMat (all journals of the Asian Chemical Editorial Society); and @angew_chem (a journal of @GDCh_aktuell).Whether it is discussing your research with family or writing a scientific paper, chemistry requires communication skills. However, the way in which we communicate to different audiences can vary enormously. Until now, the #RealTimeChem community facilitates communication between chemists, but this year we want to broaden our horizons.We would like to bring chemists into the limelight by showcasing our day-to-day activities to a public audience. We would like you to either write a tweet or tweet a short video to describe the current chemistry that you are doing (hint – it does not have to be front-line research!). You should aim to use non-technical terms where possible and keep the message simple. Remember, we are trying to broaden our horizons and not exclude people.Once you have your tweet ready to send, make sure to include #Chem4Life and one of the below hashtags, depending on the day of the week. It is important to include non-chemistry hashtags to ensure that we reach a larger audience. The best tweets which get the most public engagement will have the chance of winning a prize provided by this competition’s sponsor open access publisher Hindawi.The additional hashtags to use:#MondayMotivation#TuesdayThoughts#WednesdayWisdom#ThursdayThoughts#FridayFeeling#SaturdayMotivation#SundayMorningThere is a prize on offer for the winner (no runners up in this instance), which is a Samsung Tablet kindly provided by Hindawi. A Samsung Galaxy Tab A (10.5”, 32GB, with Wi-Fi). More details on the prize itself here.The winner will be decided by myself, @bythewayalex and the folks at Hindawi. Winner will be announced on Friday 23rd November on this blog.While the primary action for #RealTimeChem Week takes place on Twitter, there is also a blog carnival that runs alongside it. Chemistry bloggers are part of a thriving community and there are some excellent writers out there just waiting for readers.Previously #RealTimeChem Week 2016 was focused on “New elements in chemistry” (#NewElemChem) which focused on a range of topics about new experiences in the blogger’s chemical lives (round ups here and here at SciTechConnect).Last year, the blog carnival focused on #ChemTogether, where members of the community told stories about working together and collaborations during their lives as chemists. The round up can be found here.This year, it’s all about #Chem4Life:Write a blog post about the chemistry found in everyday life. This can be about the most simple task, like brushing your teeth, all the way up to complex life functions like the chemistry of how we breathe. This is your chance to show your readers that chemistry is always with us, all day long. It’s #Chem4Life.So, if you are a blogger, write a post and share it during the Week on Twitter using the hashtag #Chem4Life. The carnival this year is again being hosted here on Doctor Galactic & The Labcoat Cowboy. I will be looking out for this hashtag and will collect your blog post into round ups (twice during the week depending on numbers) so they are all in one place for easy access.There is already one entry in the blog carnival that will be hosted here on the blog from Gabriele Laudadio explaining the nature of #Chem4Life that will be released on Monday 12th to kick the whole thing off.Please note, if you don’t use the hashtag, then your post won’t be included in the carnival, so please make sure you remember to add it. I’ll also be retweeting these via @RealTimeChem to draw attention to them during the week. Happy writing!There is always room for more chemistry-based fun. If you would like to run an event or competition during #RealTimeChem Week or to sponsor one of the above events, then please get in touch with me via realtimechem@gmail.com and I’ll be happy to chat about the possibilities.

Posted on March 5, 2018 by doctorgalacticHello everyone,Tomorrow is the Royal Society of Chemistry’s official Twitter Poster Conference 2018! It’s a great way to share and discuss chemistry like you would at an international conference without all of that pesky travelling.This is the bread and butter of #RealTimeChem and I’ve challenged myself to post a question on every single #RSCPoster submission I can find:I will aim tomorrow to ask an insightful question on each #RSCPoster.

This should be the person who’s contributions via #RealTimeChem have stood out to you most this year.You can nominate your #RealTimeChemist by doing one of the following:In your nomination please include the following:The 4 most nominated #RealTimeChemists will be added to a poll on @RealTimeChem that will run until 1st January 2018.So, get nominating and happy holidays!
