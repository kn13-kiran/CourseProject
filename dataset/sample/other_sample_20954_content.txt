Other High-speed dispersion blades rotate at high RPMs to facilitate the quick impartation of solids at a fine grind. The liquid contacts the impeller blades and moves outward to flow over the teeth and break the agglomerations into increasingly smaller particles. Most high-speed dispersion blades have issues related to sufficient fluid motion to get a batch into complete uniformity. Mixer Direct addresses that problem with the HFD line of impeller blades. Each blade has axial flow blades integrated into the geometry of the blade, providing extra flow for higher viscosity applications. Stiffening plates can be used in conjunction with dispersion blades to increase blade life. Our bolt-on hubs, weld-on hubs, and blade adapter shafts allow for easy installment of all high shear dispersion blades.High Flow Dispersion Blades rotate at high RPMs to facilitate the quick impartation of solids at a fine grind.
