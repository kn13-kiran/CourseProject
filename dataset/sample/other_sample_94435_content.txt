Other The MXD Process planetary mixer is a highly versatile processing tool with
orbital impeller motion to ensure mixing of the most challenging products.
Our planetary mixer design can offer precise environment control to fit
your temperature, pressure, or sanitary application requirements. Planetary mixers are
used to blend adhesives, caulks, sealants, foods and chemical products with
viscosities up to 8,000,000 cps. In addition, the planetary mixer provides
thorough mixing of shear sensitive products where viscosity is not the
challenge. A non-planetary action dual shaft or single shaft mixer cannot
effectively process these highly viscous or highly sheer sensitive products.From disperser and top entry mixers to side entry adhesive mixing machines, we have expertise in whatever specifications you need and we can come up with the right mixing solution for you.
