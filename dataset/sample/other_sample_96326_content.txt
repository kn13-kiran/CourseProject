Other Mixing applications that don’t require a very high degree of pulverization but still need to disperse one material into the other efficiently will use impellers that provide some of both shear (turbulence) and movement. There are both radial impellers and axial impellers in this selection that can be sized for your application. Contact our engineering department via phone or chat for any sizing questions you may have on our dispersion blades.316 SS. The axial flow turbine is a classic medium shear impeller. Very effective in both low viscosity and high, this impeller type agitator allows a mixer to the break up agglomeration and impart solids effectively.
